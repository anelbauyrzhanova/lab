#Examples

#example 1
print(10 + 5)
#output : 15

#example 2
#expressions inside parenthesses are evaluated first
print((6 + 3) - (6 + 3))
#output : 0

#example 3
#multiplication * has higher precedance than +, so * is evaluated first
print(100 + 5 * 3)

#example 4
#Addition + and subtraction - has the same precedence, and therefor we evaluate the expression from left to right:
print(5 + 4 - 7 + 3)
